The problem is to predict rainfall in a subdivision, both on a monthly basis and for the entire year. In addition, the model is expected to predict the rainfall in the current month based on the rainfall in the previous three months.

To solve this problem, a linear model has been developed using historical rainfall data. The model takes as input the subdivision and the rainfall in the previous three months, and outputs the predicted rainfall for each month and for the entire year.

The model can be used to provide a formal description of the problem and its solution as follows:

Problem: Predict rainfall in a subdivision on a monthly basis and for the entire year, as well as predict rainfall in the current month based on the rainfall in the previous three months.

Input: The subdivision and the rainfall in the previous three months.

Output: The predicted rainfall for each month and for the entire year.

Solution: A linear model has been developed using historical rainfall data. The model takes as input the subdivision and the rainfall in the previous three months, and outputs the predicted rainfall for each month and for the entire year. The model can be used to forecast future rainfall patterns in the subdivision, and can help inform decision-making in areas such as agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness.
